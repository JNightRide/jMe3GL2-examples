# jMe3GL2-examples [ IN PROGRESS ]

This is a repository hosting examples of 2D games that use the [jMe3GL2](https://github.com/JNightRide/jMe3GL2) library (don't limit yourself with this library, you can integrate 2D games using other libraries).

Some examples
- dodge_the_creeps

## Getting started tutorial

If you already have knowledge about **jMe3GL2** and don't know where to start.

You can start with this first tutorial where you can create your first 2D game based on the Godot (2D) demo.

With this you will have an idea of ​​how to start with **JME3** and **jMe3GL2**, 2D games with this engine have no limits; It all depends on your imagination.

## Physics engine

**jMe3GL2** uses [**Dyn4j**](https://dyn4j.org/) as a physics engine, if this is the first time you are using this engine we recommend reading the documentation ([dyn4j-documentation](https://dyn4j.org/pages/getting-started)).
